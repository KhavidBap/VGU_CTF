# Transposition Cipher

I happened to find an old text message from my friend. The letters in there have been mixed up. Surprisingly, my friend was able to leave a note that said:

*"I didn't change any letters, I just shuffled the position of every 3 letters in that message sequence"*

Can you help me to revive the message? The flag format is **CYPHER{**[FLAG]**}**.
